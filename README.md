# ReferToOSP
(Note: designed for a mobile device such as a smartphone) 
A referral form for use with any Coaxial cable plant.

It was something I made out of boredom to teach myself a bit of javascript, HTML and CSS. I primarily used this to learn how to build forms and send pre-written emails. 

Features: 
-Parses entered data to a string and enters it into a new e-mail. 
  *The application calls a method that brings up the device's e-mail app (whether it be gmail on Android, Outlook on Windows, Thunderbird on Linux, etc.) 
-Checks for completed fields before submitting the data to e-mail. 
-Checks for duplicate channel numbers entered in the form
